DSA Using C 🚀

This repository contains my **day-by-day learning of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using the C programming language**.  
The focus is on **strong fundamentals, clear logic, and understanding time complexity** with practical C programs.

---

## 📚 What This Repository Is About

- Learning DSA from **Day 1**
- Writing clean and simple **C programs**
- Understanding **time complexity (Big-O notation)**
- Building consistency by uploading code daily
- Preparing a strong foundation for placements and interviews

---

## 📅 Day 1 – Introduction to DSA & Time Complexity

### 🔹 Topics Covered
- What is Data Structure
- What is Algorithm
- Why Time Complexity is important
- Big-O Notation
- Constant, Linear, and Quadratic Time Complexity

## ⏱️ Time Complexity Programs

### ✅ O(1) – Constant Time
Execution time does **not depend on input size**.

**File:** `constant_time.c`

✅ O(n) – Linear Time
Execution time increases linearly with input size.
Files:
Linear_time.c
Maximum_element.c
Count_elements.c
Examples include:
Looping through elements
Finding the maximum element in an array
Counting the number of elements
✅ O(n²) – Quadratic Time
Execution time increases quadratically due to nested loops.
File: Quadratic_time.c
